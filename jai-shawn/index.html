  <h1>bosswither storm</h1>
  <p> 
The Witherstorm was created by Ivor and was intended to be used to show up Gabriel, who then lost control of the storm after it started to absorb surrounding blocks. It has the same abilities as a normal Wither, but it seems to have the power to absorb blocks, making the beast stronger. It's appearance looks almost nothing like it's counterpart as the only thing that related to it and the Wither is the three heads. Apart from that, it is a massive monster that looks kind of like a floating island with three huge heads that each have 2 rows of teeth and one huge purple eyeball that can fire a tractor beam that starts sucking in anything from blocks to mobs. It also has 5 (or more) tentacles. It was thought that in Episode 3 (The last place you look) that it was killed by the formidi-bomb. However, the blast did not destroy the command block, and the beast rebuilt itself. It is two tiny witherstorms and one main Wither storm (with the command block)

The Wither Storm has another unique ability to have is heads pop out inside his body like it did in Episode 4: A Block in a Hard Place where Jesse went inside the Storm and 2 of its heads attacked him by poping out from the skin.

Composed of the same blocks as a normal Wither, the Witherstorm's only difference is the command block located under the middle Wither skull.

 <h2>animal bat <h2>
   <p>Bats can spawn in the Overworld at a light level of 3 or less on opaque blocks below layer 63. Between October 20 and November 3, they only require a light level of 6 or less to spawn. On Superflat worlds, bats spawn below the top non-air layer, ignoring the usual layer-63 limitation.
   

Drops
Bats do not drop any items or experience when killed.

Behavior[edit 
Bats are very small, being less than half a block tall and wide. They will randomly squeak. They often fly around aimlessly, tending to favor the east, and will sometimes fly into lava and catch on fire.

Bats also will often hang upside down on the underside of a solid block when idle, though they cannot hang on transparent or non-solid blocks. If a player approaches it while hanging upside down, including if the player is invisible, they start to fly away from the player.

Although the bat is a passive mob, they still despawn when going too far away, similarly to ocelots and squids.

Data values]

Bats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the mob. Their entity ID is bat.

History
     <Chikens>
     
<p>Chickens can be bred with wheat seeds (or beetroot seeds, melon seeds or pumpkin seeds in Computer and Pocket Edition, or nether wart in Console Edition) producing a baby chicken.

Thrown eggs have a 1⁄8 chance to spawn a baby chicken. If successful, there is a 1⁄32 chance to spawn 4 chicks instead. If the egg was thrown at a wall at certain angles, the chicken may spawn in the wall, causing suffocation.

Baby chickens will not drop anything when killed, unlike adult chickens.

Baby chickens will grow up in 20 minutes, although the growth can be accelerated by seeds; each use reduces 10% of the remaining time.

Drops
Chickens drop from 0 to 2 feathers, and 1 unit of raw chicken. If a chicken dies while on fire, it drops cooked chicken instead of raw chicken. The amount of raw chicken (or cooked chicken) dropped is affected by the Looting enchantment.

Chickens drop 1-3 experience when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

Behavior 
Chickens are 0.7 blocks tall and 0.4 blocks wide.

Chickens appear to wander around aimlessly, and usually swim in water. When falling they will flap their wings quickly and fall slowly, making them immune to fall damage. Despite this, they will still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage.

While in a loaded chunk, a chicken will lay one egg every 5 to 10 minutes (6000 to 12000 ticks), unless it is (or was) a part of a chicken jockey. If you are close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, a popping sound can be heard.

They share some behaviors with other "farm animals":

They are drawn to light when in a dark environment.
When struck, they run around quickly and aimlessly.
