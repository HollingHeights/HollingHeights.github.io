  <h1> MINECRAFT INFO </h1>
  <h2> Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Swedish game designer Markus "Notch" Persson and later developed and published by Mojang. The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple gameplay modes are available, including survival mode where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players, and a spectator mode where players can fly around and clip through blocks, but cannot place or destroy any. The PC version of the game is noted for its modding scene, where a dedicated community creates new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets for the game.

Minecraft received praise from critics upon release, and was nominated for and won various awards and accolades. As of June 2016, over 106 million copies have been sold across all platforms, with more than 40 million unique players each month, making it the best-selling PC game to date and the second best-selling video game of all time. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition being completed two months later.
  <h2>Boss Witherstorm</h2>
  <p> The Witherstorm was created by Ivor and was intended to be used to show up Gabriel, who then lost control of the storm after it started to absorb surrounding blocks. It has the same abilities as a normal Wither, but it seems to have the power to absorb blocks, making the beast stronger. It's appearance looks almost nothing like it's counterpart as the only thing that related to it and the Wither is the three heads. Apart from that, it is a massive monster that looks kind of like a floating island with three huge heads that each have 2 rows of teeth and one huge purple eyeball that can fire a tractor beam that starts sucking in anything from blocks to mobs. It also has 5 (or more) tentacles. It was thought that in Episode 3 (The last place you look) that it was killed by the formidi-bomb. However, the blast did not destroy the command block, and the beast rebuilt itself. It is two tiny witherstorms and one main Wither storm (with the command block).
  <p> The Wither Storm has another unique ability to have is heads pop out inside his body like it did in Episode 4: A Block in a Hard Place where Jesse went inside the Storm and 2 of its heads attacked him by poping out from the skin. </p>
  <p> Composed of the same blocks as a normal Wither, the Witherstorm's only difference is the command block located under the middle Wither skull. </p>

  <h2>Animal Bat <h2> 
  <p>Bats can spawn in the Overworld at a light level of 3 or less on opaque blocks below layer 63. Between October 20 and November 3, they only require a light level of 6 or less to spawn. On Superflat worlds, bats spawn below the top non-air layer, ignoring the usual layer-63 limitation. </p>
  <p> Bats do not drop any items or experience when killed. <p>
  <p> Bats are very small, being less than half a block tall and wide. They will randomly squeak. They often fly around aimlessly, tending to favor the east, and will sometimes fly into lava and catch on fire. </p>
  <p> Bats also will often hang upside down on the underside of a solid block when idle, though they cannot hang on transparent or non-solid blocks. If a player approaches it while hanging upside down, including if the player is invisible, they start to fly away from the player. </p>
  <p> Although the bat is a passive mob, they still despawn when going too far away, similarly to ocelots and squids. </p>
  <p> Bats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the mob. Their entity ID is bat. </p>

  <h2>Chickens</h2>
  <p>Chickens can be bred with wheat seeds (or beetroot seeds, melon seeds or pumpkin seeds in Computer and Pocket Edition, or nether wart in Console Edition) producing a baby chicken. </p>
  <p>Thrown eggs have a 1⁄8 chance to spawn a baby chicken. If successful, there is a 1⁄32 chance to spawn 4 chicks instead. If the egg was thrown at a wall at certain angles, the chicken may spawn in the wall, causing suffocation. </p>
  <p> Baby chickens will not drop anything when killed, unlike adult chickens. </p>
  <p> Baby chickens will grow up in 20 minutes, although the growth can be accelerated by seeds; each use reduces 10% of the remaining time. </p>
  <p> Chickens drop from 0 to 2 feathers, and 1 unit of raw chicken. If a chicken dies while on fire, it drops cooked chicken instead of raw chicken. The amount of raw chicken (or cooked chicken) dropped is affected by the Looting enchantment. </p>
  <p> Chickens drop 1-3 experience when killed by a player or tamed wolf. </p>
  <p> Chickens are 0.7 blocks tall and 0.4 blocks wide. </p>
  <p> Chickens appear to wander around aimlessly, and usually swim in water. When falling they will flap their wings quickly and fall slowly, making them immune to fall damage. Despite this, they will still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. </p>
  <p> While in a loaded chunk, a chicken will lay one egg every 5 to 10 minutes (6000 to 12000 ticks), unless it is (or was) a part of a chicken jockey. If you are close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, a popping sound can be heard. </p>
