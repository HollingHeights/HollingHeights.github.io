  <p>Minecraft is a game that is just made out of squares (like a sword is made of squares). Minecraft is the 2nd most popular game in the world, and Tetris is the 1st. There are also animals and monsters,vbut some monsters come out at night. </p>
  <h2>What you can do in Minecraft?</h2>

  <h2>How Do You Survive?</h2>

  <p>To survive, when you spawn in to the game in Survival (learn more about survival in next paragraph) you only have 9 minutes till night time. So first I always mine a tree, and get food and make a bed that should take about 9 minutes.<p>
  <h2>Survival and Creative</h2>
  <p> You can choose survival or creative for your world. Survival is where you have to work to stuff, but creative you just go in your inventory and you have everything so you don't have to work for stuff.<p>
