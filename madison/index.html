      <h2> cat translating 2 </h2>
        <p>When a cat stares at you and does a long meow, they either want attention or they are hungry.</p>
        <p>When a cat is laying down with their head down and they do a soft meow you know they are tired or bored.
          To tell, just look at their eyes.</p>
